# Simon-Game

June - 2022

A simple Simon Game. After using a keyboard button press or the tap of the screen the "game" will flash the next color in the sequence. The user then needs to tap the button in the order shown remembering each previous tap, because the sequence only shows the next color.

First project using JSQuery.
